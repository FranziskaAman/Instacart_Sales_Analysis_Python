## Instacart Sales Analysis 
 This is a Sales Analysis for Instacart grocery store using Python.

## Objective 
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. This is an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

## Data 
The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters: 

- orders
- products
- departments
- customers

The full details of the data can be found [here](https://www.instacart.com/store).

## Tools 
For this project, the following python libaries were used:
- pandas - for data analysis
- seaborn - for visualization

The scripts can be accessed via Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Deliverables
- 2: Jupyter Fundamentals & Python Data Types
-- Create project folder
-- Install required Python libraries
-- Create a notebook and import libraries
-- Practice coding using basic Python data types
- 3: Introduction to Pandas
● Download data and import into notebook as a pandas dataframe
● Conduct basic descriptive exploratory tasks
4: Data Wrangling & Subsetting
● Change data types of identifier variables into more suitable types and rename columns
where needed
● Access values and determine their meaning using a data dictionary
● Create new dataframes based on a certain criteria
● Answer questions about user activities based on variable frequencies
5: Data Consistency Checks
● Fix mixed-type variables
● Uncover and deal with missing values
● Uncover and remove duplicates
6: Combining & Exporting Data
● Merge a set of given dataframes
● Analyze results from merge flag frequencies
● Export merged data as a pickle file
7: Deriving New Variables
● Create new columns using conditional logic in the form of if-statements, user-defined functions, the loc() function, and for-loops
8: Grouping & Aggregating Data
● Create flags, for instance, a loyalty flag, and place them in new columns
● Create summary columns of descriptive statistics using the groupby() function
9: Intro to Data Visualization with Python
● Import and prepare a customer data set
● Merge customer data with other project data
● Create histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots for different variables and relationships between variables
10: Coding Etiquette & Excel Reporting
● Create new columns and flags using customer data to inform customer profiling
● Analyze order behavior of different customer groups
● Summarize analysis findings and describe what connections in the data you’ve found
● Create a report that describes the analysis methodology, results, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders
